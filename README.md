# Sample-Work
This is a collection of documents and projects completed during my studies, to preview the quality and style of my work. A large amount of work has not been uploaded; this is meant to be a small sample of schoolwork projects to provide insight into the topics I have taken courses in, and will continue to be updated as time permits and as subsequent projects are completed. <b>This is absolutely by no means exhaustive</b> (some projects cannot be uploaded due to instructor restrictions.
